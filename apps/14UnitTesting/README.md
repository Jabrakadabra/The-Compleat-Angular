# Ng2-UnitTesting

This is a basic seed project cloned from Ng2-Project-Setup, employing Angular2, Webpack, Typescript, and Karma/Jasmine for unit testing.  In addition, it has a few minimal components, services, etc., in order to provide examples for the Section IX, *Unit Testing Angular2 Apps*, from my outline on Angular2, which can be viewed at https://github.com/cjordanball/Articles.
